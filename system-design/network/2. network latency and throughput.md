Learn about the basic characteristics of a network that help to meet the latency and throughput goals.

We’ll first understand four important characteristics of the network—throughput, latency, jitter, and latency-bandwidth product.

Latency and throughput are two metrics that measure the performance of a computer network.

# Throughput

Throughput refers to the **average volume of data** that can logically pass through the network over a specific time.
If we have a 1 Mbps effective throughput of some link or network, we can’t send more than 1 Mb of data in a second.

# Latency

Latency is the delay in network communication. It shows the time that data takes to transfer from the sender to the receiver across the network. Networks with a longer delay or lag have high latency, while those with fast response times have lower latency.

We’re often more concerned about the user-perceived delay, which is a function of the round-trip time (RTT).

Typically, network latency has the following constituent components:

```
latency = transmission delay + propagation delay + queueing delay + switch/node processing delay
```

- **Transmission Delay**: the time to place a packet on the transmission link, e.g. the time uploading packet on media.

```
Transmission Delay = packet size / bandwidth
```

At times, sending the compressed data over the network helps to reduce data size.

- **Transmission Delay**: the time for a bit to go from start host to end host. For example, in the case of cross-continental links, the propagation delay would be large because bits need to travel from one continent to another.

```
Propagation Delay = distance / speed
```

- **Queuing Delay**: the time for a node (router or host) to hold the packet before it can process.
  Queuing delays depend on multiple factors, such as:

  - The time interval between the packets.
  - Transmission capacity of the outgoing link.
  - Current congestion conditions at the routers (networks get crowded as well).

- **Processing Delay**: the time the node (router) or end host (Server) to process the packet. It depends on the processing speed of the nodes and end host.

# Jitter 抖动

Network jitter is the variation in latency. It's also known as Packet Delay Variation (PDV). It’s the measure of how latency changes from one packet to the next. Let's say that three packets are transmitted with an equal delay between them, but one of them gets delayed. This delay is measured by the jitter.

抖动是指网络延迟随时间产生的变化。。延时一致比延时多变能为用户带来更好的用户体验。

The jitter is calculated by taking the mean of the delay's differences:
We care about jitter because for some applications (for example a video playback client), larger jitter might mean buffering more data. Usually, a network with low jitter is considered better than the one with bigger jitter values over time.

延迟会导致数据包在网络上传输延时，而当这些网络数据包以不同于用户预期的顺序到达时，就会出现抖动。

# Classifying Applications based on Latency

We can divide network applications into different classes on the basis of latency, such as elastic and real-time applications.

**Elastic applications** can tolerate the delay and real-time applications can’t tolerate substantial delay. Email is an example of an elastic application where the sender sends the email, and it’s delivered to its recipient with some delay (a few seconds).

- interactive: user need input and get responses, e.g. login
- interactive bulk: user need input and get bulk responses, e.g. file transfer
- asynchronous: user don't wait for response, e.g. email

**Real-time applications** can't tolerate the delay.

- Hard/intolerant: can't wait, e.g. video conference
- soft/intolerant: allow a little delay, e.g. web browsing
- Adaptive: some apps can adjust based on network conditions
- Non-adaptive: fixed waiting time
