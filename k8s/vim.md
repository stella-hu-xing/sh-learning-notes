The CKAD test is command line based, so you'll need to know to use Vim or another text editor. Without it, you'll be very strapped for time.

Here are some potential keys in Vim that will prove useful (I'm gonna assume you at least know how to exit the editor and navigate without the arrows ;) Note, these are case sensitive

- `Shift + A` - go to the end of the current row (insert mode)

- `Shift + C` - delete everything after the cursor (insert mode)

- `Shift + I` - go to the first letter on the current row (insert mode)

- `Shift + G` - go to the last row of data in the file

- `/Pod` - find any instances of Pod in the file

- `e` - jump to the end of the next word

- `w` - jump to the start of the next word

- `:25` - go to the 25th row in the file
